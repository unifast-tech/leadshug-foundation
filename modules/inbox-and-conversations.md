# Module: Inbox and Conversations
**Version:** 1.0

Owns contacts, conversations, messages, inbox, assignment and service responses across official and unofficial
WhatsApp transports.

## Invariants

- A conversation is unique by BU and contact, not by transport.
- Incoming webhook processing is idempotent.
- Outbound responses enforce the platform window and channel capability.

## API Endpoint Definitions

BFF routes use `/api/bff`; public integrations use `/api/v1`; webhook contracts use `/webhooks`.
